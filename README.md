## Project Description
<p align="justify">Delivering a great customer experience is hugely important for any business. The better experience customers have, the more repeat custom and positive reviews you'll receive, while simultaneously reducing the friction of customer complaints and dissatisfaction. In the hospitality industry, the customer experience is everything so it becomes a very crucial part for any hotel. This project is done to analyze how travelers are communicating their positive or negative hotel stay experience on online platforms and what are the attributes that travelers are considering while selecting a hotel so that a hotel manager can understand which elements of their hotel influence more in forming a positive reviews, hence improve the hotel's brand image. In order to solve this business problem a sentiment analysis is done on the hotel reviews and a classification model is built to get the sentiment(Positive or Negative) of the reviews. The classifier used in this machine learning app is built by fine tuning a BERT model, specifically tuned for hotel reviews, for binary classification(Positive/Negative sentiment). The dataset here is a sample which consists of 20000 reviews and ratings for different hotels, taken from different online platforms.</p>
